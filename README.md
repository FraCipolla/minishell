# minishell

This is a project from 42 coding school!
In this project we're asked to reproduce a base bash shell, implementing some built-in functionality and some shenanigans like pipes, redirections,
logic operators like && and ||, wildcard (*) and more!

The big challenge for me was to do everything without using any struct while sticking to the norm.

In the end i'm very proud of my project, it's clear, simple, and fast. And it works.

For sure one of my favorite project so far, really made me struggle deeper inside C.
